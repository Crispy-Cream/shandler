# Methods

## Interaction

### Replying

Responds to an interaction. \***Example soon\***

```javascript
interaction.reply('Bello').then(console.log);
```

### **Edit**

Edits an interaction response that was sent using the `.reply()`method. \***Example soon\***

```javascript
interaction.reply('Bello').then(m => {
    m.edit("Pog");
});
```

### **Delete**

Deletes an interaction response that was sent using the `.reply()` method. \***Example soon\***

```javascript
interaction.reply('Bello').then(m => {
    setTimeout(() => {
        m.delete()
    }, 5000)
});
```

### Follow-up Messages

Follow-up messages allow you to send multiple messages from a single interaction.\***Example soon\***

```javascript
let m = await interaction.reply("Bello");
let i = await m.reply("This is a follow-up message");
i.reply("This is another follow-up message").then(console.log);
```

Follow-up messages and interaction responses work with a unique interaction token which is generated when an interaction is created. This unique token is only valid for 15 minutes. Then, interaction response/follow-up messages sent after that won't be successful.

### Ephemeral Responses

Using flags we can create ephemeral \(private\) responses. \***Example soon\***

```javascript
interaction.reply("Ephemeral  Message", { flags: 64 });
```

This will only respond to the author of the interaction, find the [Docs here](https://canary.discord.com/developers/docs/interactions/slash-commands#interaction-response-interactionapplicationcommandcallbackdata)

```

```

### Embeds
